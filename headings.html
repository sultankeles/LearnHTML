    <!-- The text on web pages can be organized in different sections, with headings.
    Headings also help search engines like Google know what your page is about to show it to the right people.
    Headings in HTML come in different levels. You can use up to 6 levels of headings with opening and closing tags.
    In this way, you can add different headings to your page that will organize the content.
