<!-- When creating a website, the main page of the website is often named "index.html," and many web servers automatically locate and open this file. This is not mandatory and can be named differently, but in such cases, you may need to specify how to direct the web server to this specific structure and files. Therefore, naming the main file "index.html" is a good practice to ensure easy access for users of your website. -->
