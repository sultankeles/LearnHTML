<!-- Every website you have ever visited is built with HTML code.
    HTML code is based on tags.
    Tags use angle brackets <>. The angle brackets <> surround the name of the element you want to add to the page.
    Elements like buttons, text and images are added to web pages with different tags.
    It all starts with a tag.
    You can use the image tag (<img>) to add images to a web page.
    You need HTML tags to add different elements to a page. Some examples of HTML tags are;
    <button>			  <p>
    <table>              <img>
-->

<!-- HTML code tells the browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, etc.) how to display a web page. -->

<!-- Many HTML elements require both opening and closing tags.
    First of all, we need 3 main tags : html, head and body opening and closing tags.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Closing tags are very similar to the opening tags. The only difference is that they contain a forward slash / . -->

    <button> Example </button>

    <!-- You can customize the text for the button. The content of the button is placed between the tags. -->

    <button> Comment </button>

    <!-- The other one with the opening and closing is the paragraph text tag. -->

    <p> This is a paragraph text tag. </p>

    <!-- You can combine multiple elements in your code. -->
